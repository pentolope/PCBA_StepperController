"""The reviewed library-zero registry, built from the frozen evidence.

Every placement angle a release ships is the board's own angle plus a
correction that belongs to the part number rather than to the board: where the
assembly library's zero orientation differs from the footprint's, every
instance is fitted turned by the difference.

The corrections are not written here. They are derived by tools/jlc_orientation
from the library responses frozen in fabrication/jlc_orientation, and this
module only assembles what that derivation produced into the registry the
manifest carries - refusing any part whose evidence did not decide an offset,
because an entry with a number nothing established is exactly what a registry
is supposed to make impossible.

The derivation runs again during validation, from the same committed files,
and the gate fails if it disagrees with what the manifest records. So the
manifest block is a cache of a computation, not a table of opinions, and it
is regenerated rather than edited.
