"""Where the assembly library's zero is, relative to the footprint's zero.

A placement angle is not a property of the board alone. The part number's
orientation in the assembly house's library has its own zero, and where that
differs from the footprint's zero, every instance of the part is fitted turned
by the difference. The correction is therefore a property of the part, looked
up by distributor part number, and it has to come from evidence rather than
from a table somebody typed.

The evidence here is the component record the library itself serves, frozen
into this repository: the raw response body, byte for byte, and a normalised
extract of the pad positions it contains. Both are committed. The extract is
re-derived from the body every time it is read, and the offsets are scored
from the body rather than from the extract, so editing the extract cannot move
an offset - it can only make the mismatch visible.

How an offset is derived
------------------------
Each pad of the library part and each pad of the KiCad footprint is placed in
one right-handed frame, y up, measured from its own pad centroid. Pairing them
gives, per pad, the rotation that carries the library pad onto the footprint
pad. A rigid rotation makes every pad agree; the spread between them is what
says whether the evidence decides anything.

Pairing is by pad number where the two libraries number their pads the same
way, which is the strong form: it distinguishes a part from the same part
turned end for end, so it settles polarity. Where the numbering differs - a
relay whose footprint names its pads by function and whose library numbers
them by position - pairing falls back to nearest neighbour at each candidate
rotation, which decides only what the pad geometry decides. Which mode was
used is recorded per part, because the two are not equally strong.

Nothing here reaches the network unless it is asked to: `derive` reads only
committed files, and `freeze` is the separate, deliberate step that puts a
response on disk in the first place.
